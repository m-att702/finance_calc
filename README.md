finance_calc
============

financial calculator built with basic C++

It's a huge side project that I worked on during my first semester of C++ in college. I took common finance functions
and built a calculator program around them using basic C++ principles. 

The following functions are present in the finance calculator:

-- Annual Percentage Yield

-- Time Value of Money, including:
    - Present Value
    - Future Value
    - Number of Years
    - Interest Rate

-- Debt To Equity

-- Compound Interest

It was alot of fun to develop, and if you check it out, please remember that I created this program a long time ago.

Thank you, Enjoy!
